        In mathematical optimization, the cutting-plane method is any of a variety of optimization methods that iteratively 
        refine a feasible set or objective function by means of linear inequalities, termed cuts. 
        Such procedures are commonly used to find integer solutions to mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems, 
        as well as to solve general, not necessarily differentiable convex optimization problems. The use of cutting planes 
        to solve MILP was introduced by Ralph E. Gomory.\cite{wiki:cuttingplane} 

        Focus of this work is to propose the implementation of the cutting plane algorithm as an interactive web application
        that shows the algorithm's execution flow step-by-step.
        This work will result in a auxiliary learning tool to better understand and visualize how the algorithm works
        thanks to the grafical user interface exposed by the application.
        Since the developed application focuses on a geometric representation of the algorithm, it is thought to work
        with two decisional variables.
        The application was develop and tested on Google Chrome on the following machines:

        Linear programming (LP, also called linear optimization) is a method to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum

        More formally, linear programming is a technique for the optimization of a linear objective function, subject to 
        linear equality and linear inequality constraints. 
        Its feasible region is a convex polytope, which is a set defined as the intersection of finitely many half spaces, 
        each of which is defined by a linear inequality. 
        Its objective function is a real-valued affine (linear) function defined on this polyhedron. 
        A linear programming algorithm finds a point in the polytope where this function has the smallest (or largest) 
<<<<<<< HEAD
        value if such a point exists. \cite{wiki:lp}

        Linear programs are problems that can be expressed in canonical form as:
        
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{array}{ll@{}ll}
<<<<<<< HEAD
                \text{maximize}  & c^{T}x \\

                \text{and} & x \ge 0
            \end{array}
        \end{equation*}

        where $x$ represents the vector of variables (to be determined), $c$ and $b$ are vectors of (known) coefficients and 
        $A$ is a (known) matrix of coefficients.

        The expression to be maximized or minimized is called the objective function ($c^{T}x$ in this case).

        The inequalities $Ax \leq b$ and $x \ge 0$ are the constraints which specify a convex polytope over which the objective 
        function is to be optimized. 
        In this context, two vectors are comparable when they have the same dimensions. 
        If every entry in the first is less-than or equal-to the corresponding entry in the second, then it can be said 
        that the first vector is less-than or equal-to the second vector.

        Linear programming can be applied to various fields of study. 
        It is widely used in mathematics, and to a lesser extent in business, economics, and for some engineering problems. 
        Industries that use linear programming models include transportation, energy, telecommunications, and manufacturing. 
        It has proven useful in modeling diverse types of problems in planning, routing, scheduling, assignment, and design.

    \begin{section}{Overview about Cutting Plane Method}
<<<<<<< HEAD
        Cutting plane methods for MILP work by solving a non-integer linear program, the linear relaxation of the given integer 
        program. 
        The theory of Linear Programming dictates that under mild assumptions (if the linear program has an optimal solution, 
        and if the feasible region does not contain a line), one can always find an extreme point or a corner point that is 
        optimal. 
        The obtained optimum is tested for being an integer solution. 
        If it is not, there is guaranteed to exist a linear inequality that separates the optimum from the convex hull of the 
        true feasible set. 
        Finding such an inequality is the separation problem, and such an inequality is a cut. 
        A cut can be added to the relaxed linear program. Then, the current non-integer solution is no longer feasible to the 
        relaxation. 
        This process is repeated until an optimal integer solution is found. \cite{wiki:cuttingplane}
        
        \begin{subsection}{Algorithm}
            The method proceeds by first dropping the requirement that the $x_i$ be integers and solving the associated linear 
            programming problem to obtain a basic feasible solution. 
            Geometrically, this solution will be a vertex of the convex polytope consisting of all feasible points. 
            If this vertex is not an integer point then the method finds a hyperplane with the vertex on one side and all 
            feasible integer points on the other. 
            This is then added as an additional linear constraint to exclude the vertex found, creating a modified linear 
            program. 
            The new program is then solved and the process is repeated until an integer solution is found.
            \cite{wiki:cuttingplane}

            Using the simplex method to solve a linear program produces a set of equations of the form:
            \begin{equation*}
                x_i + \sum{\overline{a}_{ij}x_j} = \overline{b}_i
            \end{equation*}

            where $x_i$ is a basic variable and the $x_j$'s are the nonbasic variables. 
            Rewrite this equation so that the integer parts are on the left side and the fractional parts are on the right side:
            \begin{equation*}
                x_i + \sum{
                    \floor*{
                        \overline{a}_{ij}}
                    }x_j - \floor*{
                        \overline{b}_i
                     } = \overline{b}_i - \floor*{
                        \overline{b}_i
                     } - \sum{
                         (\overline{a}_{ij} - \floor*{
                            \overline{a}_{ij}
                        })x_j
                     }
            \end{equation*}

            For any integer point in the feasible region the right side of this equation is less than 1 and the left side is 
            an integer, therefore the common value must be less than or equal to 0. 
            So the inequality:
            \begin{equation*}
                \overline{b}_i - \floor*{
                        \overline{b}_i
                     } - \sum{
                         (\overline{a}_{ij} - \floor*{
                            \overline{a}_{ij}
                        })x_j
                     } \leq 0
            \end{equation*}

            must hold for any integer point in the feasible region. 
            Furthermore, nonbasic variables are equal to 0s in any basic solution and if $x_i$ is not an integer for the basic 
            solution $x$,
            \begin{equation*}
                \overline{b}_i - \floor*{
                        \overline{b}_i
                     } - \sum{
                         (\overline{a}_{ij} - \floor*{
                            \overline{a}_{ij}
                        })x_j
                     } = \overline{b}_i - \floor*{
                        \overline{b}_i
                     } > 0
            \end{equation*}

            So the inequality above excludes the basic feasible solution and thus is a cut with the desired properties. 
            Introducing a new slack variable $x_k$ for this inequality, a new constraint is added to the linear program, namely:
            \begin{equation*}
                x_k + \sum{
                    (\overline{a}_{ij} - \floor*{
                        \overline{a}_{ij}
                    })x_j = \floor*{
                        \overline{b}_i
                     } - \overline{b}_i,\ x_k \ge 0,\ x_k \ \text{an integer}
                }
            \end{equation*}
        \end{subsection}

        \begin{subsection}{Pseudocode}
            The following pseudocode\cite{book} represents the classical version of the algorithm, which will be used as a kickstart
            for the final web application:

            \vspace{10px}     
        \end{subsection}
    \end{section}

    \begin{section}{Implementation of the algorithm}
        In this section we will discuss the proposed implementation, but first there are some aspects that require some 
        clarifications. 
        All the problems solvable through the implementation need to be limited to two decisional variable, since the focus of
        the work is to show a geometrical representation of how the method proceeds to find a solution.
        Another point of discussion will be the algorithm itself: to allow the application to behave in the right way, 
        \textbf{Algorithm \ref{alg:cuttingplane}} will be split in multiple steps. \\
        Finally, since the target of this work is to create a graphical user interface to illustrate and better understand
        cutting-plane algorithm, computational complexity was not taken into account: this obviously leaves space for future 
        optimizations.

        \begin{subsection}{Data structures}
            The application uses a set of matrices to store the values computed at each step of the method.
            The same matrices are then used to assemble the tableau representation of the problem, which is shown on the graphical 
            user interface.
            Considering that the target of this work was to implement cutting-plane algorithm, the drawing effort was delegated to
            a ready-to-use library\cite{github:plotly} to cut development times.

            A sample problem is then represented by the following JSON file:

            \vspace{10px}
            \begin{lstlisting}[style=json,caption={JSON file example},captionpos=b,label={data:json}]
                {
                    "variables": ["x1", "x2"],
                    "objectiveFunction": [0, -1],
                    "subjectTo": {
                        "A": [
                            [3, 2],
                            [-3, 2]
                        ],
                        "b": [6, 0],
                        "sign": [-1, -1]
                    }
                }
            \end{lstlisting}
            \vspace{20px}
            
            The result will be the following (starting) geometrical representation:
            \vspace{10px}
            \begin{figure}[h]
                \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{problem1.png}
                \centering
                \vspace{20px}
                \begin{description}
                    \centering
                    \item[Figure 1] Admissible plane drawn from Listing \ref{data:json}
                \end{description}
            \end{figure}
            \vspace{10px}
            
            The separation of the matrices allows a better representation of the tableau (each section can be highlighted as one
            wishes) and simplifies operations between different parts.
            Since the project was written using JavaScript programming language, some problems rise up with error propagation due to
            the numerical representation: in this sense, an external library was used for linear algebra operations \cite{github:numbers}. 
            
            Additional lists are then used to keep track of the geometrical representation.
            We have:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item a list of points, that determines the polygon being drawn;
                \item a list of points, that stores the admissible integer points within the polygon;
                \item a list of lines, that is used to draw the constraints of the problem.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{subsection}
        
        \begin{subsection}{Custom implementation}
            The classical implementation of the cutting-plane algorithm work as a unique flow that from an input graph computes shortest paths 
            and returns them as their output.
            This work will obviously return the same output of a classical implementation, but it will also show every step that
            leads to the computation of every intermediate solution.
            It follows that the algorithm cannot work as a single block of code, but it needs to be split and modularized in multiple phases.

            The following sections will cover the content of the three phases of the custom algorithm.

            \begin{subsubsection}{Admissible space computation}
                The drawing of the starting admissible space is the first operation that will run after input is provided. 
                Its role is to populate the supporting data structures and initialize other data structures used by other features 
                (i.e.: navigable algorithm's history).
                It starts from a finite square that covers the positive section of the cartesian plane for both the variables, and intersects it
                by the portion of plane defined by the constraints to obtain the continuous admissible plane.
                The integer admissible space is then obtained by highlighting the points with integer coordinates that are contained within the
                drawn polyhedron.
                Everytime a new cut is found, this procedure is run, so that at every step of the algorithm the geoemtrical representation is
                up-to-date.
            \end{subsubsection}

            \begin{subsubsection}{Continuous optimal solution}
                The first phase takes care of finding the optimal solution of the contiuous relaxation of the problem through the resolution of
                the simplex algorithm \cite{wiki:simplex}, in its tableau form.
                This phase covers the first instruction of \textbf{Algorithm \ref{alg:cuttingplane}}.
                At each step, the algorithm selects a basic variable and a nonbasic variable and switches them to improve the value of the 
                objective function.
                Each pair of variable selected determines a pivot element, that is then used to update every row of the tableau to keep its feasibility.
                The algorithm stops when it cannot select a nonbasic variable whose entrance in the base would improve the value of the objective
                function, or the solution found is not feasible.
                If the algorithm successfully stops, we have a valid optimal solution that can be used to find a valid integer optimal solution. 
            \end{subsubsection}

            \begin{subsubsection}{Integrality check and cut search}
                The previously found solution needs to pass an integrality check to be declared as optimal for the integer problem.
                If all the components of the current solution are integer, then we already have solved the problem.
                Conversely, we need to find a cut that invalidates the previous solution while keeping the admissible integer solutions.
                Practically speaking, we introduce a new slack variable for the cut found and a constraint to the previous problem,
                obtaining a new linear programming problem that can be solved in the next step.
            \end{subsubsection}

            \begin{subsubsection}{New continuous relaxation resolution}
                Every time a new cut is found, and a new contraint is added to the previous relaxation problem, the new problem needs to be solved
                through the dual simplex method.
                While classic simplex tries to find a nonbasic variable whose entrance in the base will improve the value of the objective function,
                the dual version works by finding a good basic variable that will leave the base.
                The pair of selected variables will again identify a pivot element that is the used to update the rows of the current tableau.
                Once the dual algorithm finishes, we have a solution that needs again to be tested for integrality.
=======
        % As previously said, Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm to find shortest paths between nodes within a graph 
        % and it belongs to the class of label setting algorithms.
        % In particular, we want to find the $shortest\ path$ from a node $s$ (called $source$) to a node $t$ (called 
        % $sink$).
        % At each iteration, nodes are divided into a set of $permanent\ nodes$ and a set of $temporary\ nodes$:
        % permanent nodes are nodes whose labels cannot be improved because they are already optimal,
        % temporary nodes are nodes whose labels are not proved to be optimal\cite{book}. 
        % The distance label to any permanent node represents the shortest distance from the source to that node. 
        % For any temporary node, the distance label is an upper bound on the shortest path distance to that node.
        % The basic idea of the algorithm is to fan out from node $s$ and permanently label nodes in the order of their 
        % distances from node $s$\cite{book}.
        % Initially, we give node $s$ a permanent label of zero, and each other node $j$ a temporary label equal to $\infty$.
        % In label settings algorithms, at each iteration, a temporary node is selected so that it is removed from the 
        % temporary nodes set and inserted in the permanent nodes set\cite{book}.
        
        % \begin{subsection}{Algorithm}
        %     The idea is to select a feasible temporary node $i$ and move it in the permanent nodes set updating the 
        %     distance labels of nodes linked with $i$. 
        %     Specifically, what we do is to select a temporary node $i$ with minimum distance label and make that node a 
        %     permanent one, check its adjacency list $A(i)$ and update the distance labels of the nodes linked with $i$. 
        %     When we update the distance labels, we use the equation:
        %     $$
        %         d(j) = d(i) + c_{ij}
        %     $$

        %     where $d(j)$ and $d(i)$ are respectively the distances of node $j$ and node $i$ from the source. 
        %     If we update the distance label, then we update the precedent of node $j$ as follows: 
        %     $$
        %         pred(j) = i
        %     $$
        % \end{subsection}

        % \begin{subsection}{Pseudocode}
        %     The following pseudocode\cite{book} represents the classical version of the algorithm, which will be used as a kickstart
        %     for the final web application:

    \end{section}

    \begin{section}{Implementation of the algorithm}
        % In this section we will discuss the proposed implementation, but first there are some aspects that require some 
        % clarifications. 
        % It is not possible to perform a completely random generation of a graph, since it must be a graph on which is 
        % possible to perform a Shortest Path Problem solving algorithm.
        % Because of this, the application allows to generate a random graph valid as input for Dijkstra's algorithm, without 
        % the risk of infinite loops. \\
        % Another point of discussion will be the algorithm itself: to allow the application to behave in the right way, 
        % \textbf{Algorithm \ref{alg:dijkstra}} will be split in multiple steps. \\
        % Finally, since the target of this work is to create a graphical user interface to illustrate and better understand
        % Dijkstra's algorithm, computational complexity was not taken into account: this obviously leaves space for future 
        % optimizations.

        \begin{subsection}{Data structures}
            % The application uses simple lists of nodes and arcs to represent the graph.
            % This choice is partly forced by the library\cite{github:digraph} used to draw the graph in the graphical user 
            % interface, since the library requires this exact data structure as input.
            % Considering that the target of this work was to implement Dijkstra's algorithm, the role of the drawings was delegated to
            % a ready-to-use library to cut development times.

            % A sample graph is then represented by the following JSON file:

            % \vspace{10px}
            % \begin{lstlisting}[style=json,caption={JSON file example},captionpos=b,label={data:json}]
            %     {
            %         "nodes": [
            %             {
            %                 "id": 1,
            %                 "title": "1"
            %             },
            %             {
            %                 "id": 2,
            %                 "title": "2"
            %             }
            %         ],
            %         "edges": [
            %             {
            %                 "source": 1,
            %                 "target": 2,
            %                 "cost": 5
            %             }
            %         ]
            %     }
            % \end{lstlisting}
            % \vspace{20px}
            
            % The result will be the following graph:
            % \vspace{10px}
            % \begin{figure}[h]
            %     \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{graph1.png}
            %     \centering
            %     \vspace{20px}

            %     \end{description}
            % \end{figure}
            % \vspace{10px}
            
            % This data structure is not efficient when implementing search functions for nodes or arcs. Thus, to improve code quality, the first
            % operation after file generation will create some support data structures:
            % \begin{itemize}
            %     \item A JavaScript object that works as an index to find nodes;
            %     \item A list for each node to instantly get its leaving star.
            % \end{itemize}
            % Moreover, thanks to these additional data structure we can retrieve useful information in constant time.
        \end{subsection}
        
        \begin{subsection}{Custom implementation}
            % Classical implementations of Dijkstra's algorithm work as a unique flow that from an input graph computes shortest paths and return
            % them as their output.
            % This work will obviously return the same output of a classical implementation, but it will also show every step that
            % leads to the computation of every path.
            % It follows that the algorithm cannot work as a single block of code, but it needs to be split and modularized in 
            % multiple phases.

            % The following sections will cover the content of the three phases of the custom algorithm.
            % The algorithm works in two modes: single-target mode and multi-target mode; in multi-target mode the algorithm marks 
            % all the nodes (except for the source) as sinks and skips the third phase (see Section \ref{subsec:postprocessing}).

            \begin{subsubsection}{Preprocessing}
                % Preprocessing is the first phase that will run after input is provided. 
                % Its role is to populate the supporting data structures and initialize other data structures used by other features 
                % (i.e.: navigable algorithm's history).
                % It also covers the first steps of \textbf{Algorithm \ref{alg:dijkstra}} (rows 2-4) and updates the graph in the
                % canvas to highlight the source node and (in single taget mode only) the sink node, and to initialize distance labels
                % in the canvas. 
            \end{subsubsection}

            \begin{subsubsection}{Processing}
                % This phase is the longest and the most important one since it covers the remaining instructions on \textbf{Algorithm \ref{alg:dijkstra}}.
                % Being the most complex phase, it is split in a series of steps, and every step is composed by a set of substeps. 
                % A new step begins every time we select a node from the temporary nodes set and ends when we have visited each 
                % node directly linked to the one that started the current step. Every time a new step begins, the application updates
                % the graph in the canvas by highlighting the colour of the current node. Accordingly, within a step, a substep begins
                % every time we visit a new node from current's node leaving star: during each substep the application performs all the
                % checks needed to update the (temporary) shortest paths and distances from the source and shows what changed by:

                % \begin{itemize}
                %     \item updating colours and distance labels of every new reached node;
                %     \item updating the info box with the list of changes;
                %     \item updating the table of the (temporary) shortest paths
                % \end{itemize}

                % In short, every iteration of the outer loop ($while$ loop at line 5 of Algorithm \ref{alg:dijkstra}) is treated as a distinct step; 
                % moreover, each iteration of the inner loop ($for$ loop at line 9 Algorithm \ref{alg:dijkstra}) runs as a separate substep within the same step.
            \end{subsubsection}

            \begin{subsubsection}{Postprocessing}
                \label{subsec:postprocessing}
                % This phase is run only in single-target mode to show how the shortest path from the source to the sink is found.
                % Indeed, the application recursively fetches the precedent of each node in the shortest path starting from the sink 
                % until it gets to the source. Every time it jumps from a node to its precedent, the application highlights the nodes
                % and arcs involved in the path.

                % We can say that the application partly applies postprocessing in multi-target mode: once we get to the end of the
                % processing history, the application allows to highlight one path at a time by interacting with the shortest paths
                % table.

        \begin{subsection}{Web application GUI}
<<<<<<< HEAD
            Within this section we will show how the application appears and which parts compose the Graphical User Iterface:
            we will talk about all the possible interactions and features, and how they influence the understanding of the 
            algorithm.
            
            \begin{figure}[h]

                \end{description}
            \end{figure}

            \begin{subsubsection}{Input choices}
                \label{subsec:input}
                First page of the web application\cite{web:app} allows multiple ways to provide a problem as input for the algorithm. 
                The page is divided in three sections:
                
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item a \textbf{drop area} where to drop a properly formatted JSON file describing a problem (see Listing \ref{data:json}): 
                            it is also possible to select a file from file explorer by clicking over the area;
                    \item a small set of \textbf{sample problems} on which the application was tested: every file presents a name that points the 
                            number of nodes and arcs;
                    \item a \textbf{generation form} that allows the user to create a pseudo-random linear programming problem with two decisional
                            variables.
                \end{itemize}

                The generation form only needs the number of constraints that the problem will contain.
                The maximum number of constraints is limited to 50 since a greater number would be chaotic on the geometrical representation.
            \end{subsubsection}

            \begin{subsubsection}{Geometric representation}
                After input is provided, the graph will be drawn in the canvas: its purpouse is to help understanding what is happening while the 
                algorithm runs.
                In this section we can see the polygon created by the constraints (admissible space of the continuous relaxation) and each one of the 
                points with integer coordinates (admissible solutions of the integer problem).
                At each step, the current solution is identified by a green point to better understand how it changes during the execution of the
                algorithm.
                Every contraint is defined by a red dotted line, and each one identifies a half-plane that contributes to show the admissible space
                of the continuous relaxation.
            \end{subsubsection}
            
            \begin{figure}[h]

            \end{figure}

            \begin{subsubsection}{Tableau}
                On the top right section, during the execution of the algorithm, a tableau representation will be shown.
                It keeps track of the various data structures used within this implementation such as:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item the negative of the current value of the objective function;
                    \item the current costs of the basic variables;
                    \item the current costs of the nonbasic variables;
                    \item the current value of the basic variables;
                    \item the current value of the coefficients of basic variables;
                    \item the current value of the coefficients of nonbasic variables;
                \end{itemize}
                
                To not be excessively verbose, not all the changes on the tableau are reflected by the graphical user iterface, for example
                the pivoting operation is not completely shown: at each step the GUI can show the column gave by the entering nonbasic variable,
                the row gave by the leaving basic variable (if both are highlighted, the pivot value is highlighted too), and the new tableau obtained
                after the pivoting operation.

            \begin{subsubsection}{Input choices}
                % \label{subsec:input}
                % First page of the web application\cite{web:app} allows multiple ways to provide a graph as input for the
                % algorithm. The page is divided in three sections:
                
                % \begin{itemize}
                %     \item a \textbf{drop area} where to drop a properly formatted JSON file describing a graph (see Listing \ref{data:json}): it is also 
                %             possible to select a file from file explorer by clicking over the area;
                %     \item a small set of \textbf{sample graphs} on which the application was tested: every file presents a name that points the 
                %             number of nodes and arcs;
                %     \item a \textbf{generation form} that allows the user to create a pseudo-random graph.
                % \end{itemize}

                % The generation form needs two inputs: the number of nodes and the number of arcs.
                % The maximum number of nodes is limited to 50 since a greater number would be disadvantageous for multiple reasons:

                % \begin{itemize}
                %     \item being the focus of this work strongly graphical, the drawn graph must be understandable: too many nodes or arcs will
                %             limit this aspect;
                %     \item to completely execute the algorithm the user would need to go through every step by manually clicking on the \textbf{Next} button 
                %             (see Section \ref{subsec:interaction}): this would be frustrating when working with a very big graph;
                %     \item the chosen drawing library is not completely suited to excessively customize the available graph entities: to draw them as it was
                %             done, every entity needs to be rendered twice. So, even if the algorithm runs smoothly, when the number of entities is too big
                %             the GUI shows some rendering slowness.
                % \end{itemize}
               
                % Moreover, the number of nodes limits the number of arcs according to the following inequality:

                % $$
                %     m \leq \frac{n * (n-1)}{2}
                % $$
                
                % where $m$ is the number of arcs and $n$ is the number of nodes.

                % The generator will then create a graph with the following pattern:
                
                % \begin{figure}[h]
                %     \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{graph2.png}
                %     \centering
                %     \begin{description}

                %     \end{description}
                % \end{figure}

                % that is, node $i$-th's leaving star only contains nodes with id $> i$.

                % This pattern ensures that graph's topology never contains loops, so that the algorithm can work without problems. 


            \end{subsubsection}

            \begin{subsubsection}{Canvas}
                % After input is provided, the graph will be drawn in the canvas: its purpouse is to help understanding what is happening while the algorithm
                % runs.
                % Nodes are positioned in such a way that they would not interfere with the comprehensibility of the topology, however this is not always possible (e.g.
                % nodes having too many entering or leaving arcs): to handle these situations, it is possible to manually move nodes.
                % Each node is drawn as a circle containing its id in the center, and border colour of the circle indicates the status of the node: each status is
                % described in the legend.
                % Moreover, below each node a number can be found which represents the distance label of that node from the source.
                % Arcs are drawn as arrows that start from their source and end to their target: they can assume a subset of statuses compared to nodes but the
                % colours refer to the same legend of nodes. Near the center of each arc there can be found its cost, if its value is greater than zero.
                % On the left-below corner of the canvas is placed a minimal menu of two elements:
                % \begin{itemize}
                %     \item a \textbf{sliding bar} to zoom the canvas in or out, useful when the number of nodes is too high to display them all;
                %     \item a \textbf{center button} that computes the center of gravity of the graph and accordingly repositions the canvas;
                % \end{itemize}
            \end{subsubsection}

            \begin{subsubsection}{Interaction section}
                \label{subsec:interaction}

<<<<<<< HEAD
                Below the canvas there are some elements that help to iteract with the application:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item the \textbf{clear button} reverts the current state of the application and sends the user back to the input page;
                    \item the \textbf{download button} allows to download the current drawn graph as a JSON file;
                    \item the \textbf{navigation buttons} are used to keep executing the algorithm and visualize its history.
                \end{itemize}

                Every time the algorithm has to keep executing, the user need to press on the \textbf{Next} button (the navigation button on the 
                right): the new state is computed only once then it is stored within a proper data structure. 
                By storing every state, the application allows to navigate algorithm execution history back and forth.

            \end{subsubsection}

            \begin{subsubsection}{Formal problem representation}
                Bottom left section is dedicated to show the starting problem in canonical form. 
                To draw this part of the GUI was used a external library that parses a LaTeX document.
                The LaTeX document is computed right after the input is provided, and it is not changed by the application during algorithm execution.
            \end{subsubsection}

            \begin{subsubsection}{Info box}
                The last section provides written descriptions of what it is happening in a given state of the algorithm.
                Every step produces a change in almost all the section of the graphical user interface (except for the formal problem representation 
                section, that only shows the starting problem), which is intuitevely understandable thanks to its graphical and geometrical nature; 
                however, there are steps that cannot be effectively communicated through figures and need a written explanation.

                % On the left, there is a \textbf{Info} box that shows in which state the algorithm is with the phase number, step number and substep number:

                % The last part of this section is a written list of actions that were performed during that particular state: this information is stored with other 
                % ones regarding the state (such as status of nodes and arcs, temporary paths, distances).

                % On the right, the application shows a \textbf{Paths} table that lists the path to reach every node discovered until that point in time and their
                % distance from the source. 
                % If the selected state is the last performed by the algorithm, it is also possible to click on one particular row to display that path on the canvas.

    \begin{section}{Results and performances}
<<<<<<< HEAD
        This application can successfully run a (properly customized) classical implementation of cutting-plane algorithm for integer linear 
        programming problems. 
        It was tested on a set of problems provided within the \textbf{book}\cite{book} and on \textbf{IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio}
        \cite{web:cplex}: to compare the results a Python script (see GitHub repository \cite{github:project}) was developed to convert JSON files 
        to CPLEX models and then the resulting objective functions were compared. 
        All the tests returned the same results on both the web application and IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio.

        The application does not allow to jump to the end of the execution since its objective is to illustrate how the algorithm behaves at every 
        step, so its performaces were not taken into account (multiple matrixes instead of a unique one containing the tableau). 
        Since the objective of the work was to show the progression of the algorithm from a geometrical point of view, besides the support section
        added (info box, tableau representation, etc.), the problems solved were limited to two decisional variables (obviously limiting their 
        complexity), so the principal challange to the performaces was only given by the number of contraints on a given problem (that potentially 
        increases during the execution): due to this limits, this work did not show any particular performances' issue.
    \end{section}

    \begin{section}{Conclusions}
        The developed web application described in this work allows to correctly run cutting-plane algorithm on problems provided as JSON files 
        or generated through the application's generator, and to see a step-by-step execution thanks to a user-friendly interface that at each 
        iteration draws a geometrical representation and describes what it is really happening from the beginning to the end. 
        Moreover it is possible not only to proceed forward into the execution, but to go back in time, too: this feature allows a better 
        understanding and analysis of the algorithm and provides a different perspective.

        At this point in development, the application is surely useful when studying cutting-plane algorithm, but there are many optimizations
        and features that can be considered to improve this work. 
        An optimized algorithm to generate the polygon that defines the admissible space, a better organization of the interface to improve 
        user experience, multiple algorithms to choose, support for other input formats (e.g.: direct support for CPLEX models): this are just 
        some example of how the application can be extended in the future.

        % This application can successfully run a (properly customized) classical implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path problems. 
        % It was tested on a set of graphs that satisfy the topology provided in Section \ref{subsec:input} and on \textbf{IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio}
        % \cite{web:cplex}: to compare the results a Python script (see GitHub repository \cite{github:project}) was developed to convert JSON files to CPLEX 
        % models and then the resulting objective functions were compared. 
        % All the tests returned the same results on both the web application and IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio.

        % The application does not allow to jump to the end of the execution since its objective is to illustrate how the algorithm behaves at every step, so its 
        % performaces were not taken into account (the principal data structure used were lists). 
        % However, it is true that at every step the graph needs to be drawn again because of the library\cite{github:digraph} that was used; moreover the 
        % computational effort needed to draw the graph further increases because the library does not provide a conventional way to heavy customize graph's entities, 
        % so each one needs to be drawn again after first rendering.
        % This is not perceivable on a simple graph, but the application shows its limits while working with too large inputs.
